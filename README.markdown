# Chendra #

## Introduction ##

Chendra is a lib for using [Thrift](http://incubator.apache.org/thrift/ "Thrift") objects with [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/ "Hadoop").

The name comes from a seventeen-year-old Borneo elephant at the Oregon Zoo, the only Borneo elephant currently in the US. The Borneo elephant is thought by some to come from [Sulu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulu "Island of Sulu"), where it was imported form the island of [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java "Island of Java"). They are a critically endangered species.
